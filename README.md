This repository shows how to get data from Etsy using a keyword

The objective of this repository is show how to get data from etsy to work with this data and create predictive models. 
First I will show the API that etsy created to share the data and I will get data using some of the procedures, after that I will eliminate the duplicates and save the data 
in a csv file to use later doing data analysis.
